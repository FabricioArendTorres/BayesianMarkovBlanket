\chapter{Acknowledgments}
Special thanks go to my supervisors Mario Wieser and Sonali Parbhoo 
for continuously providing support and feedback to my work in our many meetings.

\\
Likewise, I want to thank Professor Volker Roth not only for allowing me to work on an interesting project,
but also for offering insight when I was seemingly stuck in the course of this thesis.
\\\\
Further, many thanks go to everyone involved in proofreading my work and helping me shape it to its current form.
\\
\\
Last but not least, I'm grateful to my family and friends for their encouragement and support through the process of this thesis and all the previous years leading to it.
