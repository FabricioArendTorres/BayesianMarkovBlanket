Learning sparse dependency structures between multiple variables is very crucial in many
application areas of biology and personalised medicine. In this thesis we are focusing in
particular on HIV where our aim is to estimate interactions between the viral genotype
and multiple phenotype variables. To do so, we make use of the Markov Blanket which
allows us to only estimate a specific subset of interest, namely the connections between viral
genotype and the corresponding phenotypes. However, the Markov Blanket calculates the
full posterior distribution whereas we are only interested in the MAP estimate. To overcome
this shortcoming, we extend the proposed model by introducing simulated annealing to the
models Gibbs sampler. Our approach will be evaluated on both synthetic data and the
SystemsX.ch HIV-X cohort
